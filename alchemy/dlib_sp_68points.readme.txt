The DLIB face landmark model "shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat", according
to the dlib example (http://dlib.net/face_landmark_detection_ex.cpp.html), was
trained on a dataset for non-commercial use only. I won't include this blob in
this git repository. And if you're about to use this model, pay extra attention
to legitimacy issues.

If desired, you can get the model from:
